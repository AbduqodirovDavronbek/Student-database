# Student-database
I created a student database using Node.js and Express. The database stores student information such as full name, phone number, email, address, and post index. I used Pug as the view engine to render the pages, and wrote the server-side code to handle GET and POST requests.
For the data storage, I used a JSON file to store the student data. To read and write data to the file, I created a module that handles these operations. Whenever a student is created, updated or deleted, the corresponding data is written to the file.
I also created a form to add new students, and added functionality to edit and delete students. To edit a student's information, I implemented a page with a pre-populated form that displays the student's current information. When the form is submitted, the corresponding student data is updated in the database.
Finally, I deployed the app to Netlify so that it can be accessed online. This required configuring the build command and publish directory, and linking the Netlify app to the GitHub repository.
